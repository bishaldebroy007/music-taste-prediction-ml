# music-taste-prediction-ml
I collected a small, synthetic dataset from a course available on YouTube, to practice data science and machine learning techniques. This dataset included age group, gender, and preferred music genre for a small group of individuals. I employed a Decision Tree Algorithm to train a model that predicts music genre based on age group and gender. This basic project helped me reinforce my understanding of data science and machine learning concepts.
